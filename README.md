# stackoverflow
This repository contains the code for exploring and gaining insights from the stackoverflow users survey sent out between 2011 and 2019. 

This project aims to answer three different questions: 

• How has the salary changed over the years and what has had the biggest influence on the salary?
• Is there a correlation between any of the number of programming languages one uses, experiance in years and gender? 
• Is there a significant difference in programming languages and salary depending on gender or education level?
